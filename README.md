# SOSBharat

SOSBharat is a community that is working towards betterment of bharat people with the help of technology.
In this chain of efforts we are creating a community and coming up with creative initiatives to help people.

SOS Bharat Shoutout is our first app in this mission.

Lets check how this app works.

First this app will need 3 permissions.
1. Notification access - To send notification to the user. remember this app will send notification only in sos events.
2. Location access - To get the location of the user in sos event and to define their volunteering areas. We do not save your live location without being involved in any sos event ever.
3. Camera access - To record the audio and video of the sos event.
4. Storage access - To store the audio and video of the sos event.

There are three ways to install the app. 
1. Android : Visit https://sosbharat.com on chrome on android and Add to home screen or install from playstore.
2. IPhone : Visit https://sosbharat.com on safari on iphone and Add to home screen or install from appstore.

Lets test the app.

Login with phone number and OTP.

Go to Profile and update your Name, City. 
Add your Emergency Contacts, they must approve to be added as emergency contact.

Once this is done, we request every indian to go in Volunteering tab and select their volunteering areas. They will be notified if someone in their area is in need of help.

And done, you are all set to help each other.

Now lets test the app.

When next time you login you will land on Dashboard that can also be accessed from Shoutout text on top left.

This page gives you two buttons to create SOS event.
1. SOS Button : This will send a notification to all the volunteers in your area and your emergency contacts.
2. HELP FROM EMERGENCY CONTACT : This will send a notification to your emergency contacts only.

Once pressed you are now in SOS Mode.

This page does the follwoing.
1. It starts recording audio and video.
2. It sends a notification to your emergency contacts.
3. It also sends a notification to volunteers in your area.
4. It starts fetching location (if permission is granted and location services are enabled) and keeps updating it in every 10 seconds. Nearby volunteers will only be notified if your location is fetched at least once.
5. It will also start saving 10 seconds video chunks on server and
6. It will start broadcasting audio of your mobile.

Once you are out of danger you can stop SOS event by pressing resolve button. This will stop all the activities and sends a resolve notification to all the volunteers and emergency contacts.

You have option to stop local recording and sending audio / video recording on server in profile page.
but audio broadcast will continue. 


On the other hand, once received notification, volunteers can see the list of SOS events in their notification section.
Each notification will have details and option to join that SOS event.
Once accepted, they can follow to find the location on map and reach there. They have option to discard the event. they even have option to listen to audio of the SOS event to decide about event.

If you think that this system is a positive try to spread it by sharing it with your friends and family. 
You have CommunityImpact tab on profile that will  give you your referral code and you can share it with your friends.
People can fill your referral code her eon profile page and they will be counted in your community impact.

This is our positive initiative to help each other and we wish everyone of you seeing this video not only try to use this app so help others but also join our community to think positive and make good positive impact.

Looking forward to see you in our community.

Thank you for your time.
